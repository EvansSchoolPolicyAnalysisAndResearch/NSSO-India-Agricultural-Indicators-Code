# NSSO-India-Agricultural-Indicators-Code

This repository includes Stata .do files developed by the Evans School Policy Analysis & Research Group (EPAR) for the construction of a set of agricultural development indicators using data from the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO), as part of the <a href = "https://microdata.gov.in/NADA/index.php/catalog/133"> Situation Assessment Survey (SAS) of Agricultural Households </a>. The survey covers three waves, 2002-03, 2012-13, and 2018-19. The code to produce agricultural development indicators for the 2018-19 is included on this page. We are still working on cleaning the codes for the 2002-03 and 2012-13 waves but they are available upon request. 

The codes included here generate the final set of indicators from the raw survey data for a respective survey wave. The .do files must be updated with the location of the raw data files downloaded from the microdata catalogue. Each .do file takes as inputs the raw data files organized according to how the data is included in the microdata catalogue. The .do files process the raw data and store created data sets in the folders "created_data" and "final_data. 

If you use or modify our codes, please cite us using the provided citation in the header of the do files.

In addition to authors included in the heading of each .do file we acknowledge the project lead C. Leigh Anderson.
